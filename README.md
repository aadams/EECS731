# EECS731
This will be my repo for EECS 731, Intro to Data Science


EECS 731 - Intro to Data Science is a class held in Fall of 2018 that focused on giving students and introduction to the many different techniques in data science. The idea was to find and explore many of the different facets of data science in order to better understand the subject. It also helps when exploring the subjects more in later classes.
